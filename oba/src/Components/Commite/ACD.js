                                The role of the Old Boysâ€™ Executive Committee (Exec) is to guide the ACD OBA on all operational activities to ensure
                                that the ACD OBA delivers the benefits and events for its members annually.
                                In addition, it sets the strategic direction for the ACD OBA while making sure that
                                it is aligned with the Constitution and the needs of the greater College community
                                and associated bodies, while making sure that the traditions and ethos of the ACD
                                OBA is maintained.

                                interests of the ACD OBA are represented. The Exec meets regularly under the
                                leadership of the President/ Vice President to ensure that these goals are
                                achieved. The Exec is voluntary, and elected through a nomination process
                                in the Annual General Meeting. We want the Exec itself to be representative
                                of its members and diverse in skills and resources.
